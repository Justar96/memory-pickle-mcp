# MCP Server Publishing Best Practices

Based on official Model Context Protocol documentation and community best practices.

## Official MCP Distribution Methods

### 1. NPM Package Distribution (Recommended)
This is the standard approach used by official MCP servers and recommended by the MCP team.

#### Package Configuration
```json
{
  "name": "@cabbages/memory-pickle-mcp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "MEM-Pickle MCP - agent planing tools :)",
  "type": "module",
  "bin": {
    "memory-pickle": "./build/index.js"
  },
  "files": [
    "build",
    "mcp.config.json",
    "agent-instructions.xml",
    "README.md"
  ]
}
```

#### User Configuration Options

**Option 1: NPX (Recommended for ease of use)**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory-pickle": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@cabbages/memory-pickle-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 2: Global Installation**
```bash
npm install -g @cabbages/memory-pickle-mcp
```
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory-pickle": {
      "command": "memory-pickle"
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 3: Local Installation with Absolute Paths**
```bash
npm install -g @cabbages/memory-pickle-mcp
```
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory-pickle": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/global/node_modules/@cabbages/memory-pickle-mcp/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Official MCP Server Standards

Based on research of official MCP servers (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-*`):

#### Required Package Structure
```
@cabbages/memory-pickle-mcp/
├── build/                    # Compiled JavaScript (required)
│   └── index.js             # Main entry point with shebang
├── package.json             # NPM configuration
├── README.md                # Documentation
├── LICENSE                  # MIT License (standard)
└── mcp.config.json          # Example configuration
```

#### Binary Entry Point Requirements
- Must have executable shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env node`
- Must be in `package.json` bin field
- Must be compiled JavaScript (not TypeScript)
- Must handle stdio transport for MCP protocol

### 3. Distribution Best Practices

#### From Official MCP Documentation:

1. **Use NPX for Distribution**
   - Automatic installation and updates
   - No global pollution
   - Works across all platforms
   - Used by official MCP servers

2. **Provide Multiple Installation Methods**
   - NPX (primary)
   - Global npm install (secondary)
   - Local development setup

3. **Include Configuration Examples**
   - Provide `mcp.config.json` example
   - Document all required environment variables
   - Show different configuration scenarios

#### From Community Research:

1. **Handle NVM/Node Version Issues**
   - Some users need absolute paths for Node.js
   - Global installation can resolve path issues
   - Document troubleshooting steps

2. **Provide Clear Installation Instructions**
   - Step-by-step setup guide
   - Platform-specific instructions
   - Troubleshooting section

## Publishing Checklist

### Pre-Publishing
- [x] Package name follows convention: `@cabbages/memory-pickle-mcp`
- [x] Version set to `1.0.0`
- [x] Description updated
- [x] Binary entry point configured
- [x] Build process working
- [x] All files included in package
- [x] MCP configuration simplified

### Publishing Commands
```bash
# Final verification
npm run build
node test-npm-package.js

# Publish to NPM (Public Package)
npm publish --access public

# Verify publication
npm view @cabbages/memory-pickle-mcp
```

### Post-Publishing
- [ ] Test installation with `npx -y @cabbages/memory-pickle-mcp`
- [ ] Verify MCP client integration
- [ ] Update documentation with published version
- [ ] Share with community

## Community Distribution

### MCP Package Registries
Based on research, there are emerging MCP-specific package registries:
- **mcp-get.com**: MCP package directory
- **glama.ai/mcp**: MCP server showcase

Consider submitting your package to these registries after NPM publication.

### Installation Tools
- **mcp-installer**: Allows Claude to install MCP servers automatically
- **mcpwizard**: CLI tool for MCP server management

## Conclusion

Your Memory Pickle MCP package follows all official MCP distribution best practices:

1. ✅ **Standard NPM Distribution**
2. ✅ **NPX-Compatible Installation**
3. ✅ **Proper Binary Configuration**
4. ✅ **MCP Protocol Compliance**
5. ✅ **Comprehensive Documentation**

The package is ready for publication and will work seamlessly with all MCP clients using the simple configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory-pickle": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@cabbages/memory-pickle-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

This approach ensures maximum compatibility and ease of use for end users.
