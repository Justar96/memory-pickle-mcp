## Version History

- **v1.0.0** - First public release (June 2025)
- **v2.0.0** - Internal development version (never published)
- **v1.x** - Legacy memory-only system (deprecated)

## Migration Notes

### From Previous Versions
**Important:** Starting with v1.3.0, Memory Pickle uses in-memory-only storage:
- No data persistence between sessions
- No file system dependencies
- Use `generate_handoff_summary` to create session summaries
- Save important information as markdown files for permanent storage

### Session Continuity
- During session: All data shared across tools
- Between sessions: Use handoff summaries for context transfer
